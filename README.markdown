# html-to-markdown

Want to converts from HTML to Markdown? This might be just the bit of code your looking for. This library provides a method of converting from Enlive's representation of HTML to Markdown.

## Usage

Right now the implementation is *not* prefect so using the project might be frustrating. I would suggest cloning the repository if you want to work with it so you can change the code if you run into a problem.

If you really want to use this as a dependency in one of your projects I suggest using the latest build on [Clojars](http://clojars.org/html-to-markdown).
